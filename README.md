# CFP-RSVP Option Pricing

This project started merely as a project to scrape some data from CFP-RSVP -- however, it quickly took a turn towards the silly. Data source changes, code golf, and office changes threw interesting wrenches in data collection, but we generally feel that we have a unique bit of data aggregated.

# Data

We have pulled data from the following sources:

- Massey Ratings

- Don Best

- Odds Shark

- CFP-RSVP

# Code

You will find an assortment of code within this repository. If your desire is to start pulling this data on your own, you should probably check out the *teamOptionsPullPrep.R* file. This will call the necessary functions (from the functions folder, no less) and take care of almost everything (you will need to handle a little bit of file extension renaming). We firmly believe that code should be available, warts and all, so we have also included all of our data reconciliation code. The clean version is there, but we don't want the world to think that we did this perfectly on the first shot (or the second...or the third).

# Results

Our results are generally discussed in a highly visual and descriptive manner. That is not to say, though, that we do not engage in some statistical fun.
